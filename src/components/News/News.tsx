    content:
        'Overall spending on IT products and services is expected to climb by about 5.5% this year, fueled mainly by software and services, according to a forecast from tech analyst firm Gartner Research. That level of growth would result in a total expenditure of $4.6 trillion. In the area of data center systems, which includes servers, internal controller-based systems and networking equipment among other things, the latter is likely to prove a robust engine of growth, with Gartner predicting 8.4% year-on-year growth in constant currency. According to the forecastâ€™s author, John-David Lovelock, the data center category as a whole should rise by 3.7% in 2023.',
